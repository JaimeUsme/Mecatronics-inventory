/**
 * Repository Interfaces (Ports)
 * 
 * These interfaces define contracts for data access operations.
 * They belong to the domain layer and are implemented in the infrastructure layer.
 * This follows the Dependency Inversion Principle.
 * 
 * Example structure:
 * - IUserRepository.ts
 * - ISessionRepository.ts
 * - IAuthenticationRepository.ts
